# Flutter Responsive Admin/Dashboard Template
![App UI](/ui.png)

The latest version of Flutter, version 2.*, now includes stable support for web development. I'm excited to introduce a Flutter-based Admin panel, also known as a dashboard UI. This dashboard template, available on GitHub, offers a comprehensive solution for managing the backend of your app. It includes various features such as charts, tables, and well-designed information cards.

This Flutter dashboard library is highly versatile and can be used on the web, macOS apps, tablets, as well as Android and iOS phones. It embodies the concept of "write once, run everywhere" by allowing you to write code that can be used across multiple platforms.
